Setup

Extracting your project's codea folder from the iPad can be done using [iExplorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/)

1. Run the make_project.sh script from a Terminal session. It takes a parameter which is the name of the app.
   + eg, `./make_project.sh Test` will create a folder called **Test** with a CodeaTemplate.xcodeproj file inside it and targets of the same name set up 
2. Open the CodeaTemplate.xcodeproj project in Xcode.
3. Delete the existing the Project.codea file from the Classes group and select Move To Trash
4. Rename your codea project Project.codea
5. Drag and drop your project into the Xcode project
6. Check the "Copy items into destination folder's group (if needed)"
7. Select "Create folder references for any added folders" and make sure your app's  target is selected. Click Finish
8. Setup the bundle id and Icon for your project as per usual
